# Security Architecture for Companies: Aligning Cyber Security with Business Goals

In today's digital economy, cyber security must go beyond technical controls and become an integral part of business strategy. Achieving this alignment ensures not only protection against threats but also seamless support for business goals like customer satisfaction, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency.

This article explores how the **SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture)** framework enables companies to integrate security into their business strategy. We'll examine SABSA's layers, compare it with other frameworks, provide practical examples, and enrich the discussion with visuals and additional use cases.

## What is SABSA?

SABSA is a comprehensive, business-driven security architecture framework designed to ensure that security decisions directly support business objectives. Unlike purely technical models, SABSA begins by understanding the business environment and then crafts security measures that address risks and enable growth.

### The SABSA Lifecycle Model: A Holistic Approach

SABSA's **six-layered lifecycle model** ensures a top-down alignment, starting with business goals and cascading into specific security measures.

| **Layer**                 | **Purpose**                                           | **Example**                                                      |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contextual Layer**      | Define business goals and risks.                      | A bank wants to enhance customer trust by protecting online transactions. |
| **Conceptual Layer**      | Develop high-level security principles.               | Require all transactions to use encryption and multifactor authentication. |
| **Logical Layer**         | Design logical processes and controls.                | Implement a secure login flow and real-time fraud detection.     |
| **Physical Layer**        | Select technologies to support processes.             | Use TLS for encryption, MFA tools, and fraud detection software. |
| **Component Layer**       | Deploy and configure solutions.                       | Configure TLS certificates, set up MFA, and integrate fraud detection APIs. |
| **Operational Layer**     | Monitor, manage, and optimize the architecture.       | Regularly audit the system and update security measures.         |

## Why SABSA?

Organizations often face challenges in aligning security with business priorities, such as:

1. **Conflicting Priorities**: Business teams prioritize agility, while security teams focus on risk minimization.
2. **Regulatory Pressure**: Companies must navigate complex compliance requirements without hindering operations.
3. **Resource Constraints**: Limited budgets and staff make it difficult to cover all aspects of security.

SABSA addresses these issues by creating a **risk-driven, scalable architecture** that supports business goals.
