# What is penetration testing?

**From Cloudflare:**  
Penetration testing (or pen testing) is a security exercise where a cyber-security expert attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system. The purpose of this simulated attack is to identify any weak spots in a system’s defenses which attackers could take advantage of.

This is like a bank hiring someone to dress as a burglar and try to break into their building and gain access to the vault. If the ‘burglar’ succeeds and gets into the bank or the vault, the bank will gain valuable information on how they need to tighten their security measures.

**From the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC):**  
Penetration testing is a core tool for analysing the security of IT systems, but it's not a magic bullet.

This guidance will help you understand the proper commissioning and use of penetration tests. It will also help you to plan your routine security measures so that you gain maximum benefit from this powerful but expensive operation.

### My interpretation (by no means conclusive)

Penetration testing, also known as pen testing, is a process in which security experts attempt to penetrate a computer system, network or application to find and fix security vulnerabilities. Here are the most important aspects in simple but detailed sentences:

### What is penetration testing?
Penetration testing is a methodical and planned simulation of an attack on a computer system, network or application. The aim is to identify vulnerabilities before real attackers can exploit them.

### Importance of penetration testing
Penetration testing is crucial for IT security as it helps to identify security vulnerabilities that may not be detected by other security measures such as firewalls or antivirus software. It provides a realistic overview of the security status of a system.

### Aim of penetration testing
The main goal of a penetration test is to find and fix vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure. This includes:

1. **Identification of vulnerabilities**: Testing uncovers potential security vulnerabilities such as incorrect configurations, insecure passwords and software bugs.
2. **Assessment of the security situation**: It checks how well the existing security measures protect against attacks.
3. **Recommendations for improvement**: Based on the results, recommendations are made on how security can be improved.

### Purpose of penetration testing
The purpose of penetration testing is to increase the security of a system by finding and fixing potential vulnerabilities. This prevents malicious attackers from exploiting these vulnerabilities and causing damage.

### Types of penetration testing
1. **Black Box Testing**: The tester has no information about the target system and simulates an external attacker.
2. **White Box Testing**: The tester has complete knowledge of the target system, including source code, network architecture and credentials.
3. **Gray Box Testing**: The tester has limited information about the target system, which is a mixture of black box and white box testing.

### Sequence of a penetration test
1. **Planning and reconnaissance**: Defining the scope and objective of the test and gathering information about the target system.
2. **Scanning and analyzing**: Checking the systems for open ports, services and vulnerabilities.
3. **Exploitation**: Attempting to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
4. **Aftercare**: Documenting the findings and producing a report with recommendations to remediate the vulnerabilities.
5. **Review**: Verify that the proposed security measures have been implemented and the vulnerabilities have been remediated.

Penetration testing is an important part of IT security as it proactively helps to make systems more secure and minimize potential security risks.
