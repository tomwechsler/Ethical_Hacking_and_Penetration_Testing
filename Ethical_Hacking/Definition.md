# What is Ethical Hacking?

**From EC-Council:**  
The Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH) credentialing and provided by EC-Council is a respected and trusted ethical hacking course in the industry. 
Since the inception of Certified Ethical Hacker in 2003, the credential has become one of the best options for industries and companies across the world. 

The C|EH exam is ANSI 17024 compliant, adding value and credibility to credential members. It is also listed as a baseline certification in the US Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 8570 and is a NSCS Certified Training.

**From IBM:**  
Ethical hacking is the use of hacking techniques by friendly parties in an attempt to uncover, understand and fix security vulnerabilities in a network or computer system.

**From CompTIA:**  
When many people hear the term hacking, it’s often correlated with cyberattacks. However, in today's technology driven world, there’s a group of cybersecurity professionals that essentially hack the hackers – they’re called ethical hackers.

The role of an ethical hacker is important within the cybersecurity industry. Ethical hackers are tasked with the knowledge, skills, and experience to perform risk assessments and test systems for security related issues. These tests are conducted against all possible security breaches, exploits and vulnerability scenarios that protect organizations from attacks.

### My interpretation (by no means conclusive)

Ethical hacking, also known as “ethical hacking” or “white hat hacking”, refers to the legal and authorized intrusion into computer systems, networks or applications to evaluate and improve their security. Here are the most important aspects in simple but detailed sentences:

### What is ethical hacking?
Ethical hacking is the process by which a security expert, a so-called “ethical hacker”, tests the security mechanisms of a system. This is done with the permission of the system owner to find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them.

### Importance of ethical hacking
Ethical hacking is critical to the security of IT systems. It helps organizations to identify and close their security gaps before they are discovered and exploited by malicious hackers.

### Aim of ethical hacking
The main goal of ethical hacking is to increase the security of a system. This includes

1. **Detection of security vulnerabilities**: Identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious hackers.
2. **Improvement of security measures**: Suggestions for improving the security infrastructure based on the vulnerabilities found.
3. **Protect sensitive data**: Ensure that confidential information is protected from unauthorized access.

### Purpose of ethical hacking
The goal of ethical hacking is to make a system more secure by uncovering and fixing vulnerabilities. This helps to prevent data loss, financial damage and reputational damage that can result from security breaches.

### Types of ethical hacking
1. **Web Application Hacking**: Checking web applications for security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
2. **Network Hacking**: Testing networks for vulnerabilities such as open ports, insecure services and faulty configurations.
3. **System Hacking**: Checking operating systems and servers for vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access.
4. **Social Engineering**: Human vulnerability testing using techniques such as phishing to see how employees react to manipulative attacks.

### Sequence of an ethical hacking process
1. **Planning and approval**: Agreement with the owner of the system on the scope and objective of the hacking test.
2. **Information gathering**: Gathering information about the target system to identify possible attack vectors.
3. **Vulnerability analysis**: Identification and assessment of vulnerabilities in the system.
4. **Exploitation**: Attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to understand the potential impact.
5. **Reporting**: Documenting the vulnerabilities found and recommending how to fix them.
6. **Follow-up**: Verifying that the suggested security measures have been implemented and the vulnerabilities have been fixed.

Ethical hacking is an essential part of IT security. It helps organizations protect their systems by proactively identifying and fixing potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious hackers.
