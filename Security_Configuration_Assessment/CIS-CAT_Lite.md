## Key Features of CIS-CAT Lite

1. **Automated Benchmark Assessment**:
   - The tool scans systems and compares their configurations against CIS Benchmarks.
   - Benchmarks cover a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and network devices.

2. **Detailed Reports**:
   - Reports include compliance scores, non-compliance areas, and actionable steps for remediation.

3. **Customizable Settings**:
   - Users can focus assessments on specific benchmarks or categories of concern.

4. **Easy Integration**:
   - Lightweight and straightforward, CIS-CAT Lite integrates well into smaller environments without extensive infrastructure.

## Examples of Use

### Scenario 1: SME Secures Its Server Infrastructure
A small business uses CIS-CAT Lite to evaluate its Windows Server 2019 environment. The tool identifies weak password policies and unnecessary services running on critical servers. Recommendations from the tool lead the IT team to:
- Enforce strong password complexity.
- Disable unused services, reducing the attack surface.

### Scenario 2: Audit Preparation for Compliance
A healthcare provider preparing for a HIPAA audit uses CIS-CAT Lite to ensure its Linux systems comply with security benchmarks. The tool highlights misconfigurations in SSH settings, which are promptly addressed before the audit.
