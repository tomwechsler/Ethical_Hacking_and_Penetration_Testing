The process of the ethical hacker
The ethical hacker process involves several systematic steps that are performed to identify and fix a system's security vulnerabilities. The process is similar to that of an unethical hacker, but with the difference that the ethical hacker acts legally and has the permission of the company or organization. The process consists of the following phases:

Planning and reconnaissance: gathering information about the target.
Scanning and enumeration: Identifying vulnerabilities through active and passive techniques.
Gaining access: Exploiting the vulnerabilities found.
Escalating privileges: Extending privileges to gain full access.
Maintaining access: Ensuring that access is maintained in order to perform further tests.
Reporting: Detailed list of vulnerabilities found and suggestions for improving security.
