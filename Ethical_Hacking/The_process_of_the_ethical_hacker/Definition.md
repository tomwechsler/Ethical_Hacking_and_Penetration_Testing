# The Process of the Ethical Hacker

The ethical hacker process involves several systematic steps that are performed to identify and fix a system's security vulnerabilities. The process is similar to that of an unethical hacker, but with the difference that the ethical hacker acts legally and has the permission of the company or organization. The process consists of the following phases:

## 1. Planning and Reconnaissance
Gathering information about the target.

## 2. Scanning and Enumeration
Identifying vulnerabilities through active and passive techniques.

## 3. Gaining Access
Exploiting the vulnerabilities found.

## 4. Escalating Privileges
Extending privileges to gain full access.

## 5. Maintaining Access
Ensuring that access is maintained in order to perform further tests.

## 6. Reporting
A detailed list of vulnerabilities found and suggestions for improving security.
