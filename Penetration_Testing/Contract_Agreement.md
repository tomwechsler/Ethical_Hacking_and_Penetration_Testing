## What is a penetration test contract?

A penetration testing contract is an agreement between two or more parties that establishes rules and guidelines for an organization's security testing to identify vulnerabilities in the system. 
It is crucial to have a contract in place before a security test begins. This serves to protect both the company performing the security testing and the organization receiving the testing. 
With a written agreement for the security testing, both parties can ensure that they are on the same page throughout the testing process and that all regulations are followed. 
An example of a penetration testing contract may include a common date for the start of the penetration test, the scope of work, a service level agreement, a possible date for the 
completion of the penetration test, etc. With the right preparation, a penetration testing contract is an invaluable tool for securing any organization's systems.


## Why do you need a penetration test contract?

If you use IT services or work in the field of IT security, you may be asking yourself the same question. Penetration testing is a service where a security expert attempts to find security vulnerabilities in your organization's information systems.
Security has become one of the top priorities for businesses. Criminals are getting more and more creative when it comes to stealing data and monetizing it, which has become a major problem for businesses. The world of cyber security is a whole different ball game. The malicious actors are very creative and often use the same techniques repeatedly, but in different ways. This is a big challenge for security experts.
An even bigger challenge is that companies usually have developers trying to make their applications more secure, but no security experts to help them. They have to know how to do it themselves. This gap is extremely large and it is crucial that it is closed.

A contract for penetration tests is important because it clearly defines the legal framework and the scope of the tests and avoids misunderstandings. For the client, it ensures that sensitive data and systems are protected and that only authorized tests are carried out. For the contractor, the contract provides clear instructions and protection from legal consequences should something go unexpectedly wrong. 
The contract also defines the responsibilities and obligations of both parties, which facilitates collaboration and communication. Finally, the contract ensures that the results and recommendations of the test are treated confidentially and implemented properly.
