1. **MD5**: An older cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value. It is no longer considered secure against well-funded attackers.
2. **SHA-1**: A cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit hash value. It is no longer considered secure against well-funded attackers.
3. **SHA-256**: A member of the SHA-2 family, it produces a 256-bit hash value and is currently considered secure.
4. **SHA-3**: The latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, it allows for variable output sizes and is believed to be secure against quantum attacks.

| AES-CCM         | Counter with CBC-MAC, another authenticated encryption scheme combining counter mode encryption with a CBC-MAC based authentication. | No                 |
| AES-CTR         | Counter Mode, where plaintext blocks are XORed with an encrypted counter value. The counter is incremented for each subsequent block. | No                 |
