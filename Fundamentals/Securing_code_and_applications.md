# Securing Code and Applications

## 1. Secure Coding Practices

- **Code Review**: Regular and systematic examination of the source code to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
  - Manual Reviews: Involves human experts analyzing the code.
  - Automated Scanning: Utilizes tools to detect common security issues.

- **Static and Dynamic Analysis**:
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyzes source code, bytecode, or application binaries to find vulnerabilities without executing the code.
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Tests the running application to find vulnerabilities that may not be visible in the code but can be exploited.

- **Threat Modeling**: Identifying potential threats and designing countermeasures. It includes:
  - Identifying assets and their value.
  - Determining potential threats and vulnerabilities.
  - Defining countermeasures to mitigate risks.

## 2. Application Security

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Authentication: Verifying the identity of users, systems, or services.
  - Authorization: Determining what permissions authenticated entities have.

- **Data Encryption**: Protecting data through encryption both in transit and at rest.
  - Transport Layer Security (TLS) for data in transit.
  - Encryption algorithms like AES for data at rest.

- **Secure API Design**: Ensuring that APIs are designed with security in mind.
  - Input Validation: Checking data from users to prevent SQL injection, XSS, etc.
  - Proper Authentication: Implementing OAuth, API keys, or other secure authentication methods.
  - Rate Limiting: Controlling the number of requests to prevent abuse.

- **Security Patching and Updates**: Regularly updating and patching systems to fix known vulnerabilities.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implementing continuous monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents.

- **Security Training**: Educating developers and other stakeholders about security best practices and common threats.

- **Compliance with Regulations**: Ensuring that the code and applications comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

Securing code and applications is an ongoing process that requires collaboration between developers, security teams, and other stakeholders. It's about building security into the development lifecycle, rather than bolting it on at the end. By following these practices, organizations can reduce the risk of security breaches and build trust with their users.

## OWASP Resources
One of the BEST resources for application security is [OWASP](https://owasp.org/). 
Check out the [CheetSheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/index.html), the [Web Application Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/) and the [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://owaspsamm.org/model/).
