## NIST Cyber Kill Chain 
The NIST Cyber Kill Chain is a model that describes the stages of a cyber attack. The model is used to help organizations understand the steps that an attacker takes to compromise a target. The model is broken down into seven stages, each of which represents a different phase of the attack. The stages are as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The attacker gathers information about the target to identify vulnerabilities and potential entry points.

2. Weaponization: Based on the information gathered, the attacker creates malicious software or tools that can exploit the identified vulnerabilities.

3. Delivery: The attacker delivers the malicious tool or exploit to the target, usually via email, websites or infected USB sticks.

4. Exploitation: The malicious tool is executed on the target to exploit security vulnerabilities and gain access.

5. Installation: The attacker installs malware or a backdoor on the target system to ensure long-term access.

6. Command and Control (C2): The malware connects to the attacker's server to receive commands and exchange data.

7. Actions on Objectives: The attacker carries out his main objectives, such as stealing data, manipulating systems or disrupting services.

Each of these steps describes the typical phases of a targeted cyber attack and helps to develop defensive measures for each phase.

## NIST Incident Response Life Cycle
The Incident Response Life Cycle is a structured approach to handling security incidents. It consists of four phases:

1. Preparation: Measures and tools are set up to respond quickly and effectively to security incidents.

2. Detection and Analysis: Suspicious activities and security incidents are identified and analyzed to understand their scope and cause.

3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: The incident is contained, the threat is removed and affected systems are restored to normal.

4. Post-incident activity: The incident is evaluated and documented in order to learn from the incident and to better defend against future attacks.

These phases help to ensure a structured and effective response to security incidents and to continuously improve IT security.
