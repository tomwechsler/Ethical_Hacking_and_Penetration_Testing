## What exactly is it about?

Dear community,

In today's IT world, the word security is more important than ever. Attacks, compromises, data loss, cloud services being targeted, local infrastructures being sabotaged, to name just a few scenarios.

I am aware that I cannot make the IT world more secure with this publication. But I am trying to make my small contribution here. The aim is to incorporate all my experience, knowledge and expertise in the following areas:

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS
- Microsoft (Azure, Microsoft 365, PowerShell, etc.)
- Cisco
- Amazon
- etc.

None of this happens overnight, but over weeks and months. My personal motivation is to publish new content once a week. Be it in the form of:

- Articles
- Scripts
- Tutorials
- YouTube videos (these only in German)
- Screenshots
- etc.

I look forward to an exciting "journey" with you. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Best regards  
Tom Wechsler
