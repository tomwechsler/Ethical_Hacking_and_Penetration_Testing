* [OpenAttack](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenAttack) - a Python-based textual adversarial attack toolkit.

## Prompt Firewall and Redaction

_Products that intercept prompts and responses and apply security or privacy rules to them. We've blended two categories here because some prompt firewalls just redact private data (and then reidentify in the response) while others focus on identifying and blocking attacks like injection attacks or stopping data leaks. Many of the products in this category do all of the above, which is why they've been combined._

- [Protect AI Rebuff](https://playground.rebuff.ai) - A LLM prompt injection detector. [![code](https://img.shields.io/github/license/protectai/rebuff)](https://github.com/protectai/rebuff/)
