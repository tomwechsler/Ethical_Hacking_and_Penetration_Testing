# Threat Hunting: Network Data – A Comprehensive Program

## Introduction: Why Network-Based Threat Hunting is Critical

Modern cyberattacks are **stealthy, persistent, and evasive**, often bypassing traditional defenses like antivirus and firewalls. **Threat hunting** is a **proactive cybersecurity discipline** focused on **detecting threats that evade automated detection systems**.

Among all available telemetry, **network data stands out** as the most **rich, immutable, and cross-cutting** source of evidence. Unlike endpoint data, network traffic cannot easily be hidden or tampered with once captured, making it **indispensable for detecting lateral movement, command-and-control (C2) communications, and data exfiltration**.

### Why Threat Hunting with Network Data is Important:
- **Catches advanced persistent threats (APTs)** that evade SIEM and antivirus.
- Provides **context across the entire environment**.
- Enables **early-stage intrusion detection** before damage is done.
- Helps discover **misconfigured or compromised systems**.
- Improves **incident response** and **organizational resilience**.

## Frameworks, Standards & Best Practices

Threat hunting with network data aligns with several key **cybersecurity frameworks and methodologies**:

| **Framework / Standard** | **Relevance** |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| **MITRE ATT&CK**         | Maps threat behaviors to tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Helps identify attacker patterns in network logs. |
| **NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2** | Incident handling guide that includes recommendations for proactive threat detection. |
| **NIST CSF (Identify, Detect, Respond)** | Threat hunting is a core part of Detect and Respond functions. |
| **CIS Controls v8 (Control 13)** | Network Monitoring and Defense—emphasizes anomaly detection, flow logging, and threat behavior analysis. |
| **Zero Trust Architecture (NIST SP 800-207)** | Assumes breach and requires continuous verification and monitoring of network traffic. |

**Best Practices:**
- Combine **SIEM and NDR** (Network Detection and Response) tools.
- Integrate **threat intelligence** feeds and IOCs into detection logic.
- Apply **behavioral analytics** rather than signature-based detection.
- Conduct **routine hunts**, not only during incidents.

## Objectives of Threat Hunting (Network-Focused)

### Key Objectives:
1. **Detect stealthy intrusions** that evade traditional defenses.
2. **Identify anomalous network behaviors** (e.g., beaconing, C2 activity).
3. **Uncover internal misconfigurations or rogue services**.
4. **Map threat behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs**.
5. **Improve network visibility, telemetry quality, and detection rules**.

### How to Interpret Threat Hunting Results:

| **Result** | **Interpretation** |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Unusual traffic to unknown domains/IPs** | Potential C2 or beaconing activity |
| **Rare protocol use or port scanning** | Reconnaissance or exploitation attempt |
| **Traffic spikes from low-privilege hosts** | Potential lateral movement or exfiltration |
| **Legacy protocols in use (e.g., SMBv1, Telnet)** | Misconfiguration or insecure communication |
| **Encrypted traffic to risky geolocations** | Covert exfiltration or VPN tunneling |

Each of these can indicate **malicious activity** or **policy violations**, depending on context.

## Threat Hunting Methods and Techniques

Below are **core methodologies** used in network-based threat hunting:

### **1. Least Frequency Analysis**

**Definition:** Identify **rare or unusual network behaviors** in the environment.

**Use Cases:**
- Detect beaconing to rare external IPs
- Identify malware communication to unique domains
- Spot abnormal protocol usage (e.g., ICMP exfiltration)

**How It Works:**
- Collect and normalize network flow (NetFlow, Zeek, PCAP)
- Use statistical methods to rank by frequency
- Investigate low-frequency but high-impact outliers

**Tools:** Zeek (Bro), Splunk, ELK, Velociraptor

---

### **2. Crown Jewel Identification**

**Definition:** Focus hunts on systems and network paths that contain or interact with **high-value assets** (a.k.a. “crown jewels”).

**Use Cases:**
- Protect critical business systems (e.g., finance DBs, domain controllers)
- Monitor sensitive data stores and backup servers

**How It Works:**
- Identify critical systems through BIA or asset inventory
- Map their communications and dependencies
- Monitor for unauthorized access or lateral movement attempts

**Tools:** Asset Management Platforms, NDR Tools, Firewalls with segmentation logs

---

### **3. How Hackers Abuse Network Protocols**

Attackers often **exploit legitimate protocols** to bypass security controls.

| **Protocol** | **Abuse Examples** |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **DNS**      | Covert C2 channels (DNS tunneling) |
| **HTTP/S**   | Malware beaconing via encrypted web traffic |
| **RDP/SMB**  | Lateral movement within the network |
| **ICMP**     | Ping sweeps, covert channels |
| **LDAP**     | Credential harvesting and enumeration |
| **SSH/VPN**  | Data exfiltration disguised as admin activity |

**Hunting Focus:**
- Look for unusual payload sizes or connection patterns
- Compare behavior to baseline usage
- Enrich logs with threat intel for known bad IPs/domains

## Threat Hunting Checklist (Network-Focused)

Use this checklist to guide a successful network threat hunting operation:

### **Preparation**
- [ ] Define the scope of the hunt (network segments, critical assets)
- [ ] Ensure availability of data sources: NetFlow, DNS, PCAP, Zeek logs
- [ ] Integrate MITRE ATT&CK techniques for mapping TTPs
- [ ] Collect recent threat intelligence for context

### **Execution**
- [ ] Perform Least Frequency Analysis on outbound traffic
- [ ] Identify abnormal protocol use (e.g., DNS tunneling, RDP from user workstations)
- [ ] Focus on crown jewel systems and their communications
- [ ] Analyze encrypted traffic to unusual geolocations

### **Analysis**
